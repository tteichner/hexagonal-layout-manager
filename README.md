# Hexagonal mud layout

This project intends to replicate the mud of the famous mobile game and gives you the toolkit to place the HQs of your members in a virtual position. It has support for "CTRL+z" and a local storage based saving mechanism.

You can tag the hqs you put there and import and export your current setting. As some season may have additional tiles that use up one space you can model them here too.

You are free to fork this tool or put pull requests or further improvements.
